# Adobe Analytics to CSV

## Overview

This is a tool for downloading data from Adobe Analytics' report APIs and outputting to a CSV (presumably for Excel importation).

## Pre-Requisites

### Homebrew

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you're on macOS (it'll make the following installs much easier).

### Node.js

You'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (instructions on site). If you're on macOS and have Homebrew installed, you can do this by typing into your terminal:

```bash
$ brew install node
```

## Using the Script

Will fill this out as I figure it out.
